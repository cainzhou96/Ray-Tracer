In order to compile the samples in the SDK you need the following:

0. An NVIDIA graphics card with R435.80 driver or newer. It doesn't have to be
   an RTX card. If you don't know the version of the driver, just upgrade it 
   to the newest version. 

1. CUDA Toolkit 5.0+ (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). Install the 
   latest version if you don't have CUDA yet.

2. CMake 3.0 minimum. *

3. C++ compiler (gcc 4.4 and 4.8 been tested). *

4. OptiX 6.5.0 (https://developer.nvidia.com/designworks/optix/download).

* You can install them using a package management system on Linux.

Instructions for building:

1. Install OpenGL and FreeGLUT if you haven't. On Debian or distributions 
   that are based on Debian (like Ubuntu), you can install OpenGL and 
   FreeGlut using the command
     $ sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev

2. Create a build directory under the current directory.

3. cd to new directory.

4. Run
     $ cmake -D OptiX_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=<path> ..
   where <path> is the installation path of OptiX, for instance, 
   /usr/local/NVIDIA-OptiX-SDK-6.5.0-linux64.

5. Run
     $ make
   to build.

6. You can find the executable, called PathTracer, in the bin directory under 
   your build directory. The scenes files will be at the same directory. To run 
   it, cd to bin and then 
     $ ./PathTracer Scenes/<your scene>
   where <your scene> is the scene you want to render.
